About Me
---
I am currently Associate Professor at College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, China. I am going to join Computer Science Department of Hong Kong University as a visiting research associate for a year, working with Prof. Wenping Wang and Dr. Jia Pan. Before that, I earned the Ph.D. degree from Computer Science Department at City University of Hong Kong under the co-supervision of Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau and Prof. Dinesh Manocha. During my PhD, I visited the GAMMA group at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and IVPLab at Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Dinesh Manocha and Prof. Xiaogang Wang, respectively.
